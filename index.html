About

My name is Juan Pablo, I am 42 years old, and I am from Argentina, born in France, currently living in Denmark. I studied graphic design, although I haven't been practicing it for some time. I want to become a digital nomad by programming and combining my existing design knowledge.

Experience

I have had various types of jobs. Currently, I work as a chef at a restaurant here in Copenhagen. Regarding design, I have worked in advertising agencies and printing shops in Cordoba, Argentina. As for programming, I am just starting out, and I am very excited about gaining work experience in this field.
